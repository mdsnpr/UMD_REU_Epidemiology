	abstract = {The LambertW function is defined to be the multivalued inverse of the functionw {\textrightarrow}wew. It has many applications in pure and applied mathematics, some of which are briefly described here. We present a new discussion of the complex branches ofW, an asymptotic expansion valid for all branches, an efficient numerical procedure for evaluating the function to arbitrary precision, and a method for the symbolic integration of expressions containingW.},
